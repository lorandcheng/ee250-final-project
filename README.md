# Final Project for EE250 Distributed Systems and IoT

## Idea Outline
- This project will feature a morse code to text translation and messaging system between a raspberry pi and a laptop, communicating through a cloud server.   
- There will be 3 nodes: rpi, laptop, and cloud server.   
- The rpi will use the grove sensor button and the buzzer to send and receive morse codes. In addition, it will have an LCD that displays outgoing and incoming messages.   
- The laptop will have a messaging visual page, where they can see incoming messages and reply with a text message.   
- The cloud server will host a database that stores previous messages.    

Options to consider:
Have a multi-control option with the button (long press to bring up menu, scroll with potentiometer)

Menu items:
  - delete character
  - clear screen
  - send message
  - view message history? (scroll with potentiometer)
